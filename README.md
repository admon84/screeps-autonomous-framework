# Screeps TypeScript Starter + KBot Architecture

Screeps TypeScript Starter is a starting point for a Screeps AI written in Typescript.

This forked project includes the KasamiBot architecture source code to provide additional groundwork for building your own Screeps AI.

## Architecture

Managers are used to prioritize your component logic.
* The Core Manager is the entry point for the code which controls other Managers.
* Using Managers allows Roles and functionality to be organized and run in priority order according to your CPU Bucket.

This code will equip you with the same features explained in the Tutorial (Harvester Role, Upgrader Role, Builder Role, Spawn Logic, Tower Logic, Memory Cleanup) and a foundation you can use to build your own Screeps AI with TypeScript.

## Basic Usage

You will need:

- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (10.x)
- A Package Manager ([Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started) or [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node))
- Rollup CLI (Optional, install via `npm install -g rollup`)

Download the latest source [here](https://github.com/admon84/screeps-typescript-starter/archive/master.zip) and extract it to a folder.

Open the folder in your terminal and run your package manager to install the required packages and TypeScript declaration files:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# yarn
yarn
```

Fire up your preferred editor with typescript installed and you are good to go!

### Rollup and code upload

Screeps Typescript Starter uses rollup to compile your typescript and upload it to a screeps server.

Move or copy `screeps.sample.json` to `screeps.json` and edit it, changing the credentials and optionally adding or removing some of the destinations.

Running `rollup -c` will compile your code and do a "dry run", preparing the code for upload but not actually pushing it. Running `rollup -c --environment DEST:main` will compile your code, and then upload it to a screeps server using the `main` config from `screeps.json`.

You can use `-cw` instead of `-c` to automatically re-run when your source code changes - for example, `rollup -cw --environment DEST:main` will automatically upload your code to the `main` configuration every time your code is changed.

Finally, there are also NPM scripts that serve as aliases for these commands in `package.json` for IDE integration. Running `npm run push-main` is equivalent to `rollup -c --environment DEST:main`, and `npm run watch-sim` is equivalent to `rollup -cw --dest sim`.

#### Important! To upload code to a private server, you must have [screepsmod-auth](https://github.com/ScreepsMods/screepsmod-auth) installed and configured!

## Typings

The type definitions for Screeps come from [typed-screeps](https://github.com/screepers/typed-screeps). If you find a problem or have a suggestion, please open an issue there.
